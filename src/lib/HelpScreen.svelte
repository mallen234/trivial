    Every day there will be a series of questions which have a link. You will
    likely have seen this in pub quizes up and down the UK. You can click on one
    of the questions/clues to reveal the answer but this will reduce your score
    by one.

  <p>
    If you are sure you have the right link but don't know exactly what to write
    the marker is lenient to a variation in answers so if you don't need to be
    exact, just write what comes to mind and it should hopefully understand
